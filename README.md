## 💡 What is Google Colab?

**Google Colab** (short for Colaboratory) is a free online platform provided by Google that allows you to:
- Write and execute Python code in a browser.
- Access free GPU and TPU resources for machine learning.
- Share code and collaborate in real-time with others.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Free GPU/TPU Access**: Run heavy machine learning models for free.
- **Code Execution in the Cloud**: No need for a powerful local machine.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Work on the same notebook with team members.
- **Integration with Google Drive**: Save and access notebooks directly from your Drive.
- **Rich Visualizations**: Create plots, graphs, and images using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 🛠 Sample Workflow

### Step 1: Import Libraries
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Step 2: Write Your Code
```python
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Sine Wave")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.show()
```
